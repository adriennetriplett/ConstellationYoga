				<h3 class="bold">HATHA</h3>
				A gentle introduction to the most basic yoga postures. You will leave class feeling longer, looser, and more relaxed.

				<h3 class="bold mt-3">ASHTANGA</h3>
				Ashtanga, based on ancient yoga teachings, is a rigorous style of yoga that follows a specific sequence of postures and links every movement to a breath. This is a sweaty, physically demanding practice.

				<h3 class="bold mt-3">VINYASA</h3>
				Vinyasa consists of fluid, movement-intensive practices, smoothly transitioning from pose to pose, with the intention of linking breath to movement. If you hate routine and love to test your physical limits, vinyasa may be for you.
				
				<h3 class="bold mt-3">BIKRAM</h3>
				In our Bikram class, you will sweat like never before as you work your way through a series of 26 poses in a room heated to 95 degrees. Due to the heated conditions of the studio, don't forget to bring a water bottle!

				<h3 class="bold mt-3">ANUSARA</h3>
				Based on the belief that weâ€™re all filled with an intrinsic goodness, Anusara seeks to use the physical practice of yoga to help students open their hearts, experience grace, and let their inner goodness shine through. Classes are specifically sequenced to explore the Universal Principles of Alignment, and are rigorous for the body and the mind.

				<h3 class="bold mt-3">YIN</h3>
				Yin yoga is a delicious way to relax and soothe frayed nerves. These restorative classes use holsters, blankets, and blocks to prop students into passive poses so the body can experience the benefits of a pose without having to exert any effort.
